### Contributions (Add sites)

Edit [`sites.json`](public/sites.json) file, add your site domain to corresponding array.
Please keep the domains array **unique sort**, then open a pull-request and wait. :D

**FAQ: how to see a site is using www or not?**

Use `curl -I <domain>` to see the response header, and your browser to determine it! e.g.:

```bash
$ curl -I https://www.twitter.com
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
content-length: 0
date: Sun, 09 Sep 2018 08:50:56 GMT
location: https://twitter.com/
server: tsa_k

```
